Gaming is now more than just a matter of what you do, and how good you are at it. Our application will change based on your current location. Currently, the themes, the in-game characters, the other users you can interact with, as well as the leaderboards are components that are location-based.
Given that gaming no longer depends entirely on the interface, it adds another dimension towards the game. Part of the game is to allow players who are within the same area game together, and therefore, it also opens up players to peers who may be nearby thus giving the game more than just a static approach to gaming.
